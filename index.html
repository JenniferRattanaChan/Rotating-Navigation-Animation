        <h1>Why Dogs Wag Their Tails?</h1>
        <small>Tara Yarlagadda</small>
        <p>
          It’s easy to assume a pooch is overcome with joy if it’s wiggling
          behind back-and-forth. What better symbol of happiness is there than a
          dog wagging its tail? However, science suggests reducing a dog’s tail
          wagging to a mere sign of happiness is an oversimplification of the
          way dogs use their tail to express highly complex emotions. People
          convey body language through facial gestures and eye movement. Dogs
          use other body parts, such as ears and tail, to convey how they feel.
          Certain positions, directions, and the speed of the tail wag can
          provide clues about a dog’s state of mind and intentions. In this
          article, Inverse analyzes the surprising science behind dog wagging to
          help pet owners parse out the complicated psychology underlying their
          pup’s everyday behavior. Dogs often wag their tails to express a state
          of energetic enthusiasm.

          In a 2018 study, researchers found: “Dogs wag their tails loosely from
          side to side to communicate friendliness or their excitability.” This
          association between tail wagging and positive canine social behavior
          has been proven in further research.In a 2013 study, dogs demonstrated
          excitement by wagging their tail in response to their achievements.
          The researchers write these results suggest “tail wagging may be a
          useful indicator of positive affective states in dogs.” Meanwhile, a
          1989 study published in the journal Pharmacology Biochemistry and
          Behavior found dogs wagged their tails more after a period of limited
          social contact. This may explain why dogs wag their tails so much
          after their owner’s prolonged absence. Regardless, dogs move their
          tails for any number of reasons — to convey anxiety, alertness, or
          other emotions. Some studies even suggest that tail wagging can
          correspond to a dog’s personality, though further research is still
          needed to be sure.
